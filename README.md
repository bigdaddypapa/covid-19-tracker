## Covid 19 APP

This is a coronavirus application built in ReactJs, styled with TailwindCSS and deployed to Github Pages.

The application uses the Coronavirus COVID19 API which is available at [https://corona.lmao.ninja/].

The main link we will use to fetch our JSON data is [https://corona.lmao.ninja/v2/countries] and we will fetch our data using Axios which is an npm package that you can use in place of the default fetch API in the browser.

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
