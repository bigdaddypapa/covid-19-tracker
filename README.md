## Covid 19 APP / Project 2

This app is my second project in the software engineer Program at Per Scholas. 

## App Functions and building process

This is a coronavirus application built in ReactJs, styled with TailwindCSS and deployed to Github Pages.
 
The application uses the Coronavirus COVID19 API which is available at [https://corona.lmao.ninja/].

The main link we will use to fetch our JSON data is [https://corona.lmao.ninja/v2/countries] and we will fetch our data using Axios which is an npm package that you can use in place of the default fetch API in the browser.
##
Inspired by the homework we did in class "STARWARS" where we fetch our API and display it like cards on our browser I built this app using VS CODE.
I started by using create-react-app in my project by running "npx create-react-app", deleted some of the files we are not intending on using and added new components for our projects.
